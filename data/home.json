      "Mōchirīī's a place to feel at home, find good company, belong & roam. Born from a wish for a gentler way, A guild shaped for lives that move each day. We carry our duties beyond the screen, Work, rest & worlds in between. Come when able, drift when need, Your place here waits, unchanged in its seat. A quiet, cozy corner where kind hearts stay, A cupcake home where warmth holds sway. Share in the sweetness, arrive as you are, With care in your words & kindness as law. Even long pauses find welcome here, A thirty-day cupcake nap rests clear. Leave us a note, your place still shines, Saved in spirit, in rhythm, in time."
